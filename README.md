# Plan 9: SM2 Emulator  
Anki Addon: Makes Anki buttons behave like SuperMemo/Mnemosyne

## About:
Plan 9 resurrects the revenant algorithm SM2. It strips away everything that is anki about Anki, making it one of the worst addons of all time. But sometimes going back to the basics has its benefits. There aren't three dates to choose from, there is only one date, the one predicted by the algorithm. Cards graded as hard will repeat again and again, with each repetition strengthening the memory trace. This aligns the user's fluency with the reviewed material, fine-tuning the metadata after each rehearsal.  

The plan follows three phases,  
Phase 1: Do reviews  
Phase 2: ?  
Phase 3: Mad retention  

Users who test this custom scheduler for more than a month should see a noticeable difference in the number of daily reviews and retention. Optionally, filtered decks maybe used to compensate for short-term retention in situations where mass studying is required.

<i>Ratings:</i>  
Thumb it down to express this addon's awfulness.


## Configs:
Addon must be activated per deck under deck options menu.

For version 1 scheduler on anki 2.0 and 2.1.  
<i>Why not support the V2 scheduler?</i>  
Anki21 is by no means matured. It could be taxing trying to keep up with the lapses.

## Profiles:
Normal - Use this for regular learning.  
Slacker - Use this if you use alternate study sources (e.g. Duolingo).  
Vacation - Use it when you need a break, but do not abuse this one.  
Beefcake - Similar to anki's default profile (mass study).  
Defer Leech - Auto adjust initial intervals based on previous lapses.  

<i>Profile settings only affects the first two intervals on new/lapsed cards.</i>

If you would like to use SuperMemo in your applications, the simplest solution is to implement the Algorithm SM-2, which is described at supermemo.com. You do not need to license that algorithm. It is open to the public. Our only requirement for such cases is a prominent credit given to the authors of SuperMemo. You have to include the following copyright note and site reference regarding the Algorithm SM-2:
