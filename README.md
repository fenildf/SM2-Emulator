If you would like to use SuperMemo in your applications, the simplest solution is to implement the Algorithm SM-2, which is described at supermemo.com. You do not need to license that algorithm. It is open to the public. Our only requirement for such cases is a prominent credit given to the authors of SuperMemo. You have to include the following copyright note and site reference regarding the Algorithm SM-2:
